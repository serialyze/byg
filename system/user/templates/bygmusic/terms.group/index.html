				The Services may also include determining the number of advertisement units and specific placements (ad slots) within its network available to Band to sell and manage on an ongoing basis. </li>

				<li><strong>Site Changes.</strong>  Band shall not make any substantive changes to its site/fan pages which would eliminate a Campaign during the term thereof.   Band shall provide seven to ten (7-10) business days’ notice to Company in the event of proposed non-substantive changes by Band to site/fan page layout, future advertisement slot availability and specific advertisers being deployed by Company on the Band’s site and fan page networks.  For purposes of this paragraph, “non-substantive” shall mean any change that does not eliminate advertisements, relocate advertisements outside customer visual range, or otherwise move ads to adversely affect the advertisements value without simultaneous replacement of the changed condition with similar condition of comparable value.
